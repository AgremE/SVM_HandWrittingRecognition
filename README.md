# SVM_HandWrittingRecognition

# Project Description

In this project, I build a hand writting classification program using support vector machine with data from MNIST dataset.

# How to run program

To try out the classification pipeline, run dataClassifier.py from the command line. This will classify the
digit data using the default classifier (mostFrequent) which blindly classifies every example with the mostasdfasdfasdf
frequent label.asdf

python dataClassifier.py

To activate the Support Vector Machine, use -c SVM:

python dataClassifier.py -c SVM

To run on the face recognition dataset with different training data size, use -d faces and -t numTraining
